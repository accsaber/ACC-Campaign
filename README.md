# ACC-Campaign
Beat Saber campaign for becoming an ACC Champ and testing your accuracy!

The campaign is initially divided into three paths, true, standard, and tech acc. You'll need to clear one path all the way to one of the ACC Champ milestones and pass it to join the clan. It's important to note that this campaign is not intended to be an introduction to acc, it starts hard and rapidly gets harder. At the time of writing, the final milestone and several of the levels preceding it aren't passable by anyone. All of the levels are simply acc requirements, there's none of the frustrating "maintain acc" challenges you might be familiar with from the 115 guild progression campaign.
